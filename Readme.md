# 📖 About

VidShare is a YouTube-inspired video streaming platform built to explore what goes into a real-world media application beyond basic CRUD operations.

The project focuses on designing a scalable backend architecture while implementing features commonly found in production streaming platforms, including secure authentication, media uploads, playlists, subscriptions, analytics, and watch history.

Rather than simply storing videos, VideoHub demonstrates how authentication, cloud storage, database relationships, and RESTful APIs work together in a complete application.

# 📡 API Overview

| Module | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Authentication | User login & registration |
| Users | Profile management |
| Videos | Upload, publish & manage videos |

# 💡 Engineering Decisions

Some notable implementation decisions made during development:

- Media files are stored on Cloudinary instead of the application server.
- Authentication uses JWT access and refresh tokens for better security.
- Business logic is isolated inside controllers to keep routes lightweight.
- MongoDB ObjectId references are used to model relationships between users, videos, comments, playlists, and subscriptions.
- Middleware is used extensively to handle authentication, uploads, and request validation.

# 🚧 Potential Future Work

- Adaptive bitrate streaming (HLS)
- Video transcoding queue
- Redis caching
- Email verification
- Live streaming
- Recommendation engine
- Unit & Integration tests
- Kubernetes deployment
